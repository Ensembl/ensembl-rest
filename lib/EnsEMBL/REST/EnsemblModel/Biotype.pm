=head1 NAME

EnsEMBL::REST::EnsemblModel::Biotype
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides access to all biotypes in a given species for both genes and
transcripts. The code will loop through all available GeneAdaptor instances
in the registry as a guide to applicable DBs. Please use the
C<EnsEMBL::REST::EnsemblModel::Biotype::get_Biotypes()> method
to populate the object.

=item biotype - String name of the biotype

=item groups - ArrayRef[String] Groups this biotype is found in

=item objects - ArrayRef[String] The object type this biotype was found in

  Args [1]    : Catalyst Catalyst context instance to use for lookup
  Args [2]    : String Species name to lookup
  Example     : my $biotypes = EnsEMBL::REST::EnsemblModel::Biotype->get_Biotypes($c, 'human');
  Description : Loops through all available GeneAdaptor instances for the given species and
                queries for distinct biotypes in the gene and transcript table.
  Returntype  : ArrayRef of Biotype objects
  Exceptions  : SQL based exceptions
