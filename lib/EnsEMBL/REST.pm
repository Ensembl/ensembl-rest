# Note that ORDERING IS IMPORTANT here as plugins are initialized in order,
# therefore you almost certainly want to keep ConfigLoader at the head of the
# list if you're using it.
#
#         -Debug: activates the debug mode for very useful log messages
#   ConfigLoader: will load the configuration from a Config::General file in the
#                 application's home directory
# Static::Simple: will serve static files from the application's root
#                 directory
#     SubRequest: performs subrequests which we need for the doc pages
#          Cache: Perform in-application caching

# details given here can function as a default configuration,
# with an external configuration file acting as an override for
