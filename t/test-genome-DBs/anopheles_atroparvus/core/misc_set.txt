1	encode	Encode regions	Regions that were examined in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">Encode</a> pilot project.	1877426
2	genomicctg	Genomic contigs	The largest contigs constructed by the Genome Reference Consortium, <a rel="external" href="http://genomereference.org">GRC</a>, for this genomic assembly.	100530253
3	tilepath	Tilepath	BAC clones upon which the current genomic assembly was based.  Colours indicate a finished sequence (gold clones), phase 1 sequencing (dark pink), phase 0 (light pink) or other (grey).  Clones that have been fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped are marked with a black triangle in the top left corner.  If a clone is shown in outline, the mapping to the genome is problematic and the true length may not be displayed.	1071649
9	encode_excluded	ENCODE excluded regions	Genomic regions that have been identified as problematic in the human genome by the ENCODE project. These regions contain abnormally high unique-mapping read coverage signal in open chromatin and control/input datasets across many cell lines and are classified as dispersed high mappability artifacts, dispersed low mappability artifacts, satellite repeats, centromeric repeats, telomeric repeats or snRNA repeats.	4132352
