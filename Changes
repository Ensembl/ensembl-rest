This file documents the revision history for Perl extension EnsEMBL::REST.

1.4.4 - 07-11-2013

Bugfixes

    - [/xrefs] fails to report linkage types for ontology xrefs
    - [/homology/id] and [/homology/symbol] failed when querying for the 
      same species as the member

1.4.3 - 05-11-2013

Bugfixes:

    - [/lookup/id] and [/xrefs/symbol] were using the parameter object rather than object_type
    - [/homology] endpoints would accept only one instance of target_taxon and target_species. 
      We now allow multiples as  intended

1.4.2 23-09-2013

Bugfixes:

    - [/feature/id] Querying for features using a negative stranded 
      feature reversed the strand of the retrieved object

1.4.1 09-09-2013

Bugfixes:

    - Lookup with a non-indexed stable identifiers in databases other than 
      core failed

1.4.0 03-09-2013

New Features:

    - Improved error page when a user goes to an unknown documentation page

    - Rate limiter responds with a Retry-After header once limits have been hit

    - [/assembly/info] should return those Slices which are part of the
      karyotype

    - [/feature/translation/:id] Support the retrieval of splice sites with
      respect from a translation

    - [/feature/translation] Improved translation feature support for GFF3

    - [/info/analysis] Support retrieval of analysis logic names

    - [/info/analysis] to provide logic names available

    - [/info/biotype] Support for listing available biotypes

    - [/info/data] has been sped up for Ensembl Genomes servers (Ensembl
      Bacteria)

    - [/info/external_db] Support retrieval of external dbs

    - [/info/external_dbs] Support the retrieval of external dbs

    - [/lookup/id] Provide more information for a lookup ID

    - [info/biotypes] Support retrieval of biotypes from the rest api

Bugfixes:

    - REST GFF CDS Line is incorrect. ID can repeat in a single GFF file

    - [/compara/homology] throws an exception when requesting ENSEMBL_PROJECTION
      ortholog alignmnets

    - [/feature/id] does not work for regulatory regions

    - [/feature/id] is failing as it thinks species is a HASH ref

    - [/genetree/symbol] and [/feature/translation] modified to default object
      type

    - [/ontology/descendents/:id] Using the zero_distance parameter destroys any
      output

    - [/ontology/id/:id] Giving a bogus ontology ID causes a stack trace

1.3.2 16-04-2013

New Features:

  - [/info/species] allows you to specify a division to limit the data by

Bugfixes:

  - [/homology/id] and [/homology/symbol] have improved error 
    reporting when IDs and symbols cannot be found

1.3.1 15-04-2013

Bugfixes:

  - [/vep] could not find a region due to changes in the backing Lookup 
    object

1.3.0 09-04-2013

New Features:

  - [/feature/id] allows for the querying of features overlapping a 
    stable ID
  
  - [/genetree/member/id] allows for the querying of a GeneTree by one 
    of its member's stable ID
  
  - [/genetree/member/symbol] allows for the querying of a GeneTree by
    one of its member's symbols (its name e.g. BRAF)
  
  - [/taxonomy/] provides methods for querying the Ensembl taxonomy 
    database. This is a mirror of NCBI's taxonomy.
  
  - [/ontology/] provides methods for querying the Ensembl ontology 
    database
  
  - [/lookup/id] replaces [/lookup] but the old endpoint remains active. 
    This endpoint now supports genomic location reporting of features when 
    output format is set to full. Please use the new endpoint.
  
  - Model::Registry supports use of Ensembl Genomes' Bio::EnsEMBL::LookUp 
    object to help loading bacteria datasets
  
  - All location based services no longer support underscores as a numeric 
    separator. All now support UCSC names for sequence regions
  
  - Support for CrossOrigin resource sharing via Plack::Middleware::CrossOrigin

Configuration:

  - [/species/info] now supports the vast numbers Ensembl Bacteria brings 
    into the registry
  
  - All models if they need access to the Catalyst context object implement 
    methods to access this without explicit pass throughs. Affects all 
    Models apart from Registry

Bugfixes:

  - Model::Registry has Bio::EnsEMBL::LookUp configuration attributes

  - Controller::Taxonomy allows for database name configuration

  - Controller::Ontology allows for database name configuration


1.2.0 15-02-2013

New Features:

  - Support for Sereal encoding format from Sereal::Encoder. MIME type
    application/x-sereal is required and extension support is
    .sereal
  
  - Support for MessagePack encoding format from Data::MessagePack. MIME type
    application/x-msgpack is required and extension support is
    .msgpack

Configuration:

  - Configuration has switched to a more Catalyst friendly method. Config
    is namespaced to the object which uses it and is accessible via local
    accessors in that object. 
    
    Registry and Documentation are prefixed with Model:: 
    Feature and Sequence are prefixed with Controller::
    All other configuration sections are unaffected

Bugfixes:

  - [/feature] CDS no longer report a protein as an exon's ID since 
    ID should be unique in a file. Instead this is available via the 
    protein_id attribute

1.1.2 24-10-2012

Output:

  - [/homology] now supports the retrieval of CDNA sequences

Bugfixes:

  - [/feature] had incorrect documentation WRT features available

1.1.1 24-10-2012

Bugfixes:

  - [/sequence/region] had not been recoded for our multiple sequence 
    changes resulting in a broken service
    
  - Documentation needs to internally escape characters like + for 
    example as Catalyst does not like this
    
  - [/vep] was attempting to multiple intron_number and exon_number 
    to avoid stringification of numerics; these two fields are not numeric

1.1.0 23-10-2012 

New Features:

  - [/feature] new endpoint for retrieval of features by a genomic location

  - [/sequence] now responds to Content-type text/plain with an unformatted
    raw String of sequence

  - Plack::Middleware::Throttle is an optional install; custom extensions 
    available with this checkout. Brings rate limiting to the REST API service

  - Using CHI to cache documentation API responses
  
  - Content type detection carried out using file name extensions as well
    as the existing mechanisms. Supported on all endpoints
  
  - [/sequence] supports multiple sequences from a single identifier e.g. 
    proteins from a gene identifier
  
  - Online change log
  
  - [/genetree] now supports CDNA sequence in PhyloXML output

Output:

  - [/vep] alleles now an array with allele_string explicit instead of as key.

  - [/info/species] reports the division of a species; Ensembl Genomes 
    extension
  
  - Mime types changed for many services to denote non-standard types. We now
    use text/x-fasta, text-x-gff3, text/x-seqxml+xml and text/x-phyloxml+xml.
  
  - [/genetree] has had NHX format retired in favor of PhyloXML
  
  - [/map] Translate coordinates for transcript/translation to genomic 
    now reports the sequence region name

Bugfixes:

  - 2 Y regions returned from [/assembly/info/human] fixed
  
  - JSON serialiser mis-encodes numerics as Strings due to MySQL DBD issues
  
  - Location parser method does not handle GL1923.1 properly
  
  - [/genetree] parameter nh_format has no effect on the newick output

Configuration:

  - Removal of <Compara> configuration option; new code introduced to 
    select the best compara available based upon species.division
  
  - Documentation supports variable replacement for easier configuration by
    third parties
  
  - CHI cache support in configuration; see CHI's POD and our production
    configuration about how you can configure it
  
  - URL, name and logo now configurable

1.0.0 05-09-2012
	- Initial revision of REST API
	
	- Support for comparative genomics, cross references, ID lookup, 
	  mapping coordinates, sequences & variations
	  
	- Information endpoints also made available
	
	- Documentation added for all end points
