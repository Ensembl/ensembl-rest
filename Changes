This file documents the revision history for Perl extension EnsEMBL::REST.

1.1.0 

New Features:

  - [/feature] new endpoint for retrieval of features by a genomic location

  - [/sequence] now responds to Content-type text/plain with an unformatted
    raw String of sequence

  - Plack::Middleware::Throttle is an optional install; custom extensions 
    available with this checkout. Brings rate limiting to the REST API service

  - Using CHI to cache documentation API responses
  
  - Content type detection carried out using file name extensions as well
    as the existing mechanisms. Supported on all endpoints
  
  - [/sequence] supports multiple sequences from a single identifier e.g. 
    proteins from a gene identifier
  
  - Online change log
  
  - [/genetree] now supports CDNA sequence in PhyloXML output

Output:

  - [/vep] alleles now an array with allele_string explicit instead of as key.

  - [/info/species] reports the division of a species; Ensembl Genomes 
    extension
  
  - Mime types changed for many services to denote non-standard types. We now
    use text/x-fasta, text-x-gff3, text/x-seqxml+xml and text/x-phyloxml+xml.
  
  - [/genetree] has had NHX format retired in favor of PhyloXML
  
  - [/map] Translate coordinates for transcript/translation to genomic 
    now reports the sequence region name

Bugfixes

  - 2 Y regions returned from [/assembly/info/human] fixed
  
  - JSON serialiser mis-encodes numerics as Strings due to MySQL DBD issues
  
  - Location parser method does not handle GL1923.1 properly
  
  - [/genetree] parameter nh_format has no effect on the newick output

Configuration:

  - Removal of <Compara> configuration option; new code introduced to 
    select the best compara available based upon species.division
  
  - Documentation supports variable replacement for easier configuration by
    third parties
  
  - CHI cache support in configuration; see CHI's POD and our production
    configuration about how you can configure it
  
  - URL, name and logo now configurable
