In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00017]

The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny."

Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00012]
