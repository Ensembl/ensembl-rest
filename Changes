This file documents the revision history for Perl extension EnsEMBL::REST.

1.2.0 15-02-2013

New Features:

  - Support for Sereal encoding format from Sereal::Encoder. MIME type
    application/x-sereal is required and extension support is
    .sereal
  
  - Support for MessagePack encoding format from Data::MessagePack. MIME type
    application/x-msgpack is required and extension support is
    .msgpack

Configuration:

  - Configuration has switched to a more Catalyst friendly method. Config
    is namespaced to the object which uses it and is accessible via local
    accessors in that object. 
    
    Registry and Documentation are prefixed with Model:: 
    Feature and Sequence are prefixed with Controller::
    All other configuration sections are unaffected

Bugfixes:

  - [/feature] CDS no longer report a protein as an exon's ID since 
    ID should be unique in a file. Instead this is available via the 
    protein_id attribute

1.1.2 24-10-2012

Output:

  - [/homology] now supports the retrieval of CDNA sequences

Bugfixes:

  - [/feature] had incorrect documentation WRT features available

1.1.1 24-10-2012

Bugfixes:

  - [/sequence/region] had not been recoded for our multiple sequence 
    changes resulting in a broken service
    
  - Documentation needs to internally escape characters like + for 
    example as Catalyst does not like this
    
  - [/vep] was attempting to multiple intron_number and exon_number 
    to avoid stringification of numerics; these two fields are not numeric

1.1.0 23-10-2012 

New Features:

  - [/feature] new endpoint for retrieval of features by a genomic location

  - [/sequence] now responds to Content-type text/plain with an unformatted
    raw String of sequence

  - Plack::Middleware::Throttle is an optional install; custom extensions 
    available with this checkout. Brings rate limiting to the REST API service

  - Using CHI to cache documentation API responses
  
  - Content type detection carried out using file name extensions as well
    as the existing mechanisms. Supported on all endpoints
  
  - [/sequence] supports multiple sequences from a single identifier e.g. 
    proteins from a gene identifier
  
  - Online change log
  
  - [/genetree] now supports CDNA sequence in PhyloXML output

Output:

  - [/vep] alleles now an array with allele_string explicit instead of as key.

  - [/info/species] reports the division of a species; Ensembl Genomes 
    extension
  
  - Mime types changed for many services to denote non-standard types. We now
    use text/x-fasta, text-x-gff3, text/x-seqxml+xml and text/x-phyloxml+xml.
  
  - [/genetree] has had NHX format retired in favor of PhyloXML
  
  - [/map] Translate coordinates for transcript/translation to genomic 
    now reports the sequence region name

Bugfixes:

  - 2 Y regions returned from [/assembly/info/human] fixed
  
  - JSON serialiser mis-encodes numerics as Strings due to MySQL DBD issues
  
  - Location parser method does not handle GL1923.1 properly
  
  - [/genetree] parameter nh_format has no effect on the newick output

Configuration:

  - Removal of <Compara> configuration option; new code introduced to 
    select the best compara available based upon species.division
  
  - Documentation supports variable replacement for easier configuration by
    third parties
  
  - CHI cache support in configuration; see CHI's POD and our production
    configuration about how you can configure it
  
  - URL, name and logo now configurable

1.0.0 05-09-2012
	- Initial revision of REST API
	
	- Support for comparative genomics, cross references, ID lookup, 
	  mapping coordinates, sequences & variations
	  
	- Information endpoints also made available
	
	- Documentation added for all end points
