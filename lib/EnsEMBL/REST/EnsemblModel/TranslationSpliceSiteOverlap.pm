Provides a way of accessing splice site information for a translation specifically those
whose codons are held by two different exons

=item translation - Translation this splice site is linked to

=item start - The position this feature start at

  Args [1]    : Bio::EnsEMBL::Translation Translation to calculate splice sites for
  Example     : my $splice_sites = EnsEMBL::REST::EnsemblModel::TranslationSpliceSiteOverlap->get_by_Translation($translation);
  Description : Loops through all available translatable exons and detects those which have their base pairs
                represented by more than one exon
  Returntype  : ArrayRef of TranslationSpliceSiteOverlap objects

  Returntype  : HashRef Basic representation of the current object
