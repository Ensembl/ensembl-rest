936	KYUGEN:CHMJ	74	DNA was extracted from complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), a benign tumor formed by the fertilization of an empty ovum by a single haploid sperm, that later duplicates its chromosomes to give a diploid (duplicated haploid) cell mass. CHMs offer a unique opp,ortunity for determining long-range definitive haplotypes at a genome-wide level.The 74 CHM samples were collected by the nation-wide effort in Japan (cooperated with the Japan Association of Obstetricians & Gynecologists). Both the female donors of the C,HM tissues and the male partners were Japanese. The project has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Kyushu University.	0	\N	UNDISPLAYABLE	\N
